# `<main>`

Represents the dominant content of the `<body>` of a document.

A document should only have one `<main>` element that doesn't have the `hidden` attribute specified. 

The content of a `<main>` element should be unique to the document .
Content that is repeated (sidebars, copyright info, site logo...) should not be included.

`<main>` doesn't contribute to the document outline, it's strictly informative.
