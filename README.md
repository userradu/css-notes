# Semantic HTML

*Semantics* - the study of the meanings of the words
*Semantic elements* - elements that describe their meanings to both the browser and the developer
*Non semantic elements*: `<div>`, `<span>`

## Benefits of using semantic elements:

1. it will influence the page's search rankings (SEO)
2. screen readers can use them
3. the code can be easier understood by developers


# `<main>`

Represents the dominant content of the `<body>` of a document.

A document should only have one `<main>` element that doesn't have the `hidden` attribute specified. 

The content of a `<main>` element should be unique to the document .
Content that is repeated (sidebars, copyright info, site logo...) should not be included.

`<main>` doesn't contribute to the document outline, it's strictly informative. 

*Not supported in IE*
